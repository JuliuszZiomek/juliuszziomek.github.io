I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford, supervised by [prof. Michael A. Osborne](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/). 
My studies are funded by EPSRC and the Oxford-Ashton Memorial Scholarship.
My research interests include Bayesian Optimisation and Reinforcement Learning. Have a look at [My research](https://juliuszziomek.github.io/bo/) subpage for more information.
In 2024 I worked as an intern at [Sakana.ai](https://sakana.ai/) under the supervision of [Llion Jones](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_3_P5VwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), one of the creators of the transformer architecture.
 
Before joining Oxford, I worked for a year as a Research Engineer at Huawei R&D London office, under the supervision of [Haitham Bou-Ammar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AE5suDoAAAAJ&hl=en). During my time at Huawei, I invented the [RDUCB algorithm](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ziomek23a/ziomek23a.pdf) and contributed its implementation to Huawei's open-source library [HEBO](https://github.com/huawei-noah/HEBO).

Before Huawei, I graduated with an MSc with Distinction in Statistics with Data Science at the University of Edinburgh - the birthplace of Bayesian Statistics. 
I also obtained the best student award for my academic performance during this degree. See the [CV](https://juliuszziomek.github.io/cv/) subpage for more details about my education and employment.
